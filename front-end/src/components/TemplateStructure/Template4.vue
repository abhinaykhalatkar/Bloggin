      <div class="blog">
      <p class="card-text mb-auto">In this series of articles I want to share with you how I got into the world of
      programming. I never went to university to study IT, but I found a way around it. If you like the series and
      want to see a book out of this, please leave a comment below.

      At the end of 2006, I arrived at a crossroads in my life. My hopes of becoming a secondary school
      linguistics teacher had vanished in an instant, as several factors had come together and made it impossible
      for me to continue with my studies.

      Back in my hometown of Durazno, Uruguay, my wife was working long hours for a meager $160 (USD) a month.
      Yes, that’s $1,920 a year. We had sacrificed our time together so I could become a teacher and get a better
      job because we were dreaming of a better future.

      The problem with dreams is they tend to vanish when you wake up, and life’s alarm clock had just gone off.

      Because my career trajectory had suddenly strayed off course, I moved back to my hometown to figure out my
      next steps. Needless to say, I was depressed at the way things were, and our living situation only made
      things worse. It was good to be back with my wife, but the reasons for it were stressful.</p>
