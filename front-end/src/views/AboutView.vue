          <p class="card-text mb-auto">In this series of articles I want to share with you how I got into the world of
            programming. I never went to university to study IT, but I found a way around it. If you like the series and
            want to see a book out of this, please leave a comment below.

            At the end of 2006, I arrived at a crossroads in my life. My hopes of becoming a secondary school
            linguistics teacher had vanished in an instant, as several factors had come together and made it impossible
            for me to continue with my studies.

            Back in my hometown of Durazno, Uruguay, my wife was working long hours for a meager $160 (USD) a month.
            Yes, that‚Äôs $1,920 a year. We had sacrificed our time together so I could become a teacher and get a better
            job because we were dreaming of a better future.

            The problem with dreams is they tend to vanish when you wake up, and life‚Äôs alarm clock had just gone off.

            Because my career trajectory had suddenly strayed off course, I moved back to my hometown to figure out my
            next steps. Needless to say, I was depressed at the way things were, and our living situation only made
            things worse. It was good to be back with my wife, but the reasons for it were stressful.</p>

          <p class="card-text mb-auto">Hi there üëãüèºüòÑ My name is Sumaya and thanks to Intermittent Fasting (or IF for
            short), in 7.5 months I‚Äôve dropped 50 pounds, 10.5% in body fat and 40 inches around my body. These results
            are entirely as a result of IF as I was unable to exercise for the first several months due to a fractured
            foot.

            After college, I spent at least 5+ years in the overweight category (no thanks to bad habits, traveling and
            eating out) before spending another 5+ years in the obese category (no thanks to startup stress, late nights
            and even more work travel). I‚Äôm now officially in the normal weight category (according to my BMI).

            I tried everything from Jenny Craig/Weight Watchers to going to the gym 4‚Äì5x a week to weekly meal prep.
            While I did see some results, I eventually couldn‚Äôt keep up with it and then yo-yo‚Äôd. IF has been the
            simplest and most manageable way I have found to improve my health (and stick with it).</p>
